I started my Open Source career as looking for a solution, but ended up being part of a growing culture of a systemic problem. While the problem as I know it cannot be traced to any individual or company; I do believe that it comes from a misconception of the original goals Open Source sought to achieve. While the goals are Open & free software we often misinterpret this as 
“roll my own software”, “I could make xyz better”, all kinds of narcissistic ideals which when considered are not in fact ideals at all.

JavaScript has become the defacto and go to solution for anything. We write backends, frontends, databases and even IoT in JavaScript but why? We are a fractured ecosystem. I’d like to focus on existing OSS which needs more work. Thanks to all who contributed.
